# DOJORDLE

Dojordle is wordle, but dojordle. Yes, you heard that right, this is revolutionising the future of the wordle world (what a mouthful).

# How do I dojordle?

Download the files (readme.md and license.md are optional, of course), open index.html and there's dojordle.
So cool.
Just a warning, only type words when you know what you're writing. You cannot do backspace _as of right now_. But you can type any word, _as of right now_.

# When will you add this?

Don't worry, I'll try to make this project better over the time.
